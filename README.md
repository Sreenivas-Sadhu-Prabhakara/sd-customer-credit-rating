# Customer Credit Rating

BIAN Service Domain microservice — part of the [bian-platform](../../bian-platform/) landscape.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Business Area** | Risk and Compliance |
| **Business Domain** | Credit Risk |
| **Functional Pattern** | Assess |
| **Asset Type** | Credit Rating |
| **Control Record** | Credit Rating Assessment |
| **K8s Namespace** | `bian-risk-compliance` |
| **Stack** | Java 21 · Spring Boot 3 · Resilience4j · Cilium mesh |

> ⚠️ **Phase 1 (shallow):** real REST API over an in-memory store. Phase 2 replaces the store with per-domain persistence and real domain logic. This repo was stamped from `bian-platform/generator` — regenerate rather than hand-editing boilerplate.
